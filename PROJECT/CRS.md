## 1. Scope

This document explains the customer's problem and defines the essential project requirements and guidelines. It serves as a foundation and a common reference for all project stakeholders. A further focus is on defining the software requirements from a user and customer perspective, so that the development team understands the product vision and can translate it into tangible functions.

## 2. Introduction

![overview image](images/CRS/Introduction.png)

The central goal of this project is the functional extension of the Eclipse BaSyx user interface, particularly the editor and viewer plugins and the corresponding REST API backend. The extension is aimed at users who need a seamless and automated integration of existing engineering data, such as that available in KBL or VEC files, into the Asset Administration Shell (AAS).

At its core, the application should enable users to integrate external model files directly into the AAS. Instead of transferring data manually, the solution creates an efficient workflow in which the files are not only plausibility-checked and correctly linked, but also analyzed in terms of content. Essential information, such as technical data from wire harnesses, is automatically extracted and transferred to standardized submodels. This significantly reduces manual effort and increases data consistency.

Furthermore, the REST API will be extended to allow direct access to data points within attached XML files. This internal data can then be visualized in a structured and user-friendly way in the viewer. The customer benefit thus lies in the creation of a more powerful and intelligent user interface that makes it possible not only to manage complex data from external sources, but also to use and understand it directly in the context of the AAS.

## 3. Use Cases

### 3.1 UC01 Import with plausibility check and MimeType detection

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use Case ID** | UC01 |
| **Description** | The user wants to import an external model file with a specific format (KBL, VEC) or a general data format into the application. The application performs a plausibility check to ensure that the file extension and the actual content structure of the file match. After successful verification, the correct MimeType is set and the file is made available for further processing. |
| **Precondition** | The model file (e.g. KBL/VEC/XML/AML) exists on the user's local system. |
| **Postcondition on Success**| The file has been successfully validated. The correct MimeType has been determined and stored. The file is now available for subsequent processing steps (e.g., AAS generation). |
| **Triggering Event** | The user selects the file using an import function and starts the upload process. |

### 3.2 UC02 XML viewer with navigation and display functions

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use Case ID** | UC02 |
| **Description** | The user wants to view the contents of an XML file (e.g., imported KBL/VEC or AML data). The application provides an XML viewer that displays a table of contents for the XML document to facilitate navigation. The user can navigate to the appropriate section of the document using the table of contents.|
| **Precondition** | A valid XML file has already been successfully imported. |
| **Postcondition on Success**| The XML content is displayed clearly. Users can navigate to the relevant section of the XML file using the table of contents and view the details (including IDs) of the individual nodes. |
| **Triggering Event** |The user opens the viewer of an asset.|

### 3.3 UC03 AAS generator from KBL/VEC

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use Case ID** | UC03 |
  | **Description** | The user wants to automatically generate an `Asset Administration Shell (AAS)` from prepared model files. The application provides a wizard that analyzes the KBL/VEC data and generates the AAS structure (submodels and submodel elements). All properties selected by the user in the wizard are transferred to the AAS. Generation is performed via the API of the AAS generator.  |
| **Precondition** | A valid model file (e.g., KBL file) is available. The connection to the AAS generator (REST API) is active. |
| **Postcondition on Success**| A new AAS has been successfully generated, in which all supported data selected by the user is mapped from the model file as submodel elements. The created AAS is stored on the VWS server. |
| **Triggering Event** | The user starts the AAS Generation Wizard and selects a model file. |


### 3.4 UC04 Automated extraction of specific XML entries from the AAS

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use Case ID** | UC04 |
  | **Description** | An external system or internal backend service wants to retrieve specific, individual XML entries from the AAS model previously generated by UC03. The application provides a backend interface (REST API) that enables targeted data queries by transmitting a specific query point (e.g., the ID of an element or a path in the XML/AAS model). The interface then returns only the desired information (e.g., the value of a specific property).  |
| **Precondition** | An AAS model was successfully generated by UC03 and is available on the AAS server. The requesting system knows the ID or path of the desired XML/AAS entry. |
| **Postcondition on Success**| The backend interface automatically and accurately returns the requested specific XML/AAS information to the requesting system. |
| **Triggering Event** | The external system/backend service sends an API request to the interface containing the desired query point (path/ID).|

## 4. Customer Requirements
The requirements are described with an ID and an overview to enable the development team to understand and implement them in the development process. 

### 4.1 Functional Requirements

The functional requirements are prioritized from 1 to 5 to indicate which requirements are most important to implement. 5 means very important and 1 means not so important.


#### 4.1.1 FR.01 MimeType Detection of Model Files

| Field | Content | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| **Requirement ID** | FR.01 | 
| **Overview** | The application must correctly identify all supported model file types (e.g., KBL, VEC, XML, AML) upon upload and automatically assign the corresponding IANA-compliant MimeType. | 
| **Acceptance Criterion** | Based on the file extension, the system recognizes the file type (e.g., KBL, VEC, XML, or AML). | 
| **Priority** | 5 | 

#### 4.1.2 FR.02 Plausibility Check (Extension vs. Content)

| Field | Content | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| **Requirement ID** | FR.02 | 
| **Overview** | Before further processing, the application must perform a plausibility check that verifies the file extension against the actual content (start line/structure) of the file for agreement. | 
| **Acceptance Criterion** | In case of a conflict between extension and content (e.g., an .xml file starting with PK), the upload is aborted, and an informative error message (see FR.06) is issued. | 
| **Priority** | 4 | 

#### 4.1.3 FR.03 Table of Contents in XML Visualization

| Field | Content | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| **Requirement ID** | FR.03 | 
| **Overview** | The Viewer plugin must display the data of an attached XML file in a structured table of contents to enable navigation through the document. | 
| **Acceptance Criterion** | When a user opens an AAS and clicks on the Viewer, a new view displays the table of contents and the XML file. | 
| **Priority** | 4 | 
| **UI** | Â ![FR001 XML Viewer Sketch](images/CRS/XMLViewer.png)|


#### 4.1.4 FR.04 AAS Generator Wizard and Property Adoption

| Field | Content |
